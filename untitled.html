	<p> This artwork/image shows a "meme", about XD. XD is famously used for abbreviating laughter and judging by the use of it, it is considered informal. Many humans use the word as a joke, and also as a reply, to literally everything. We all create strange objects, some which don't even make sense, but yet we use them day to day, unknowingly.</p>
